     Ohashi and napkins (serviettes) are included free of charge with every order, but a
                minimum of $10 (¥1,068) must be spent with every order or we will mock you. And
                please keep in mind that although Ninja Burger™ provides free delivery in most areas, a

     A FOREWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
     As I write this foreword, Ninja Burger is exactly one year old. It was invented
                in one of those spur-of-the-moment silliness sessions during which we (the
                creators) were discussing how useful it would be to have a fast food delivery
                service that could deliver inside a locked building. Out here in Silicon Valley, this is a
                real issue, so we took it upon ourselves to flesh out the idea even further by creating 
                the website (www.ninjaburger.com) for this imaginary restaurant.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     Though it started out small, Ninja Burger quickly took off like an untethered pig
                balloon at a Pink Floyd concert (except it had nothing to do with pigs, balloons or
                rock music). What it did involve was ninja and fast food. And if there's one thing
                everybody in the world knows and loves, it's ninja and fast food. Two things. Sorry.
                The point being, as an astute Hollywood representative told us a few months ago,
                Ninja Burger is "high concept." Meaning, it's something that everyone immediately
                understands.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     When you're growing up, you're given a steady dose of swordfights with sticks,
                pseudo-karate chops on your friends and fast food hamburgers (hold the rehydrated
                onion). And at some point, you're expected to give all that up and behave like a
                sensible adult. Which is a true tragedy, as far as we're concerned, because no one
                should ever have to give up something they love. Unless it involves gerbils. Because
                that's just wrong.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     And that's exactly why you now hold a copy of the Ninja Burger RPG in your hands
                (the ninja thing, not the gerbil thing). Because aethereal FORGE and 9th Level
                Games both agree that there is a time and place for acting like a responsible human
                being, and there is a time and place for drinking beer, eating pizza and pretending
                you're a ninja deliveryperson. The time for the latter is right now. We haven't
                figured out the other part just yet.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     At this point in its history, Ninja Burger has
                been seen by over 100 thousand people,
                across all 50 states and in 24 countries
                around the world (and those are just the ones
                who admit it). We're happy that you've
                chosen to join our rapidly growing cian.
                Please feel free to fill out an application,
                polish your spatula, and get ready to kick
                some Samurai oshiri. And most importantly,
                be sure to tell your friends. Ninja Burger is
                nothing without you, and with the rate at
                which we lose ninja during delivery missions,
                we need all the help we can get.

     INTRODUCTION
    </h3>
    <p>
     Who wouldn't want to be a Ninja master of the martial arts, capable of
                becoming one with the night, fearless, possessing great martial and spiritual
                powers to amaze and terrify your enemies? All that, plus a kickin', black
                costume and a bad-ass sword!
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     The problem is, of course, to become a Ninja you have to be born into a Ninja clan.
                Furthermore, you have to start your training at age five, instead of going to kindergarten. 
                Forget cartoons and tree houses; you spend years learning to be silent and
                motionless while hanging from a tree branch by your toes. Instead of learning to
                play nice with other children in a friendly game of Duck-Duck-Goose, you learn
                survival techniques from a man yelling Duck! Duck! DIE! In lieu of naptime, you
                learn to hold your breath for hours underwater. And while other kids play at cat's
                cradle, you must master the nine finger-knitting positions of kuji-kiri in order to
                focus your energies. Don't forget about your social skills, which are sure to suffer,
                due to the hours spent alone in silent contemplation. But it all seems worth it when
                you don that slick black costume and slay your first enemy. The discounts on fast
                food are pretty cool, too.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     As great as all that sounds, we can't go back in time to relive our lives, so we at 9th
                Level Games offer you this game as an alternative to becoming a Ninja. And best of
                all, it only takes minutes to master, instead of years, unless you're a really slow
                reader.

     NINJA BURGER MEMORANDUM
    </h2>
    <p>
     <strong>
      To:
     </strong>
     Newly Appointed Ninja Burger™ Franchisee-san
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      From:
     </strong>
     Enlightened Ninja Burger™ Management
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     Welcome, honorable Ninja Burger™ franchisee! You are
                now an owner/operator of your own simulated Ninja
                Burger™ delivery service. Ninja Burger: The Role-Playing Game
                is in every respect a realistic and historically accurate
                simulation of the actual Ninja Burger™ delivery business.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     The real Ninja Burger™ business has very strict hiring practices; 
                it says right on the application that you must be Ninja
                to work for Ninja Burger™, for Buddha's sake! (Actually, hiring guidelines 
                do not demand that you be Ninja, but suggest that you be able to kill an opponent
                with single bare-handed technique. See www.ninjaburger.com for complete details.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     We realize that not everyone is lucky enough to have been born
                into an honorable Ninja clan and to have begun training at
                age five. Therefore, we (The Enlightened Board of Ninja
                Burger™ Masters) created Ninja Burger: the RPG (with the help
                of some stupid gaijin game designers from 9th Level Games) so
                non-Ninja could experience the satisfaction of working for our
                company. We, the enlightened Ninja Masters at Ninja Burger™,
                sincerely hope that those of you not trained in the arts of
                ninjutsu or bunjinkan will enjoy this simulation instead of
                trying to work for us, since we are tired of having to dispose
                of your bodies.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     As a Ninja Burger: the RPG owner/operator you have important
                responsibilities. First, you must find employees (often
                referred to as players by our gaijin game designers). Next, you
                must decide who will be the Ninja Manager. The Ninja Manager
                is in charge of telling the employees what is happening in the
                simulation as they work toward their objectives. You will also
                need to provide other mission-critical supplies like pens,
                pencils, paper, six-sided dice and a conference table (a kitchen
                table will do in a pinch). Our insipid game designers suggest
                you offer suitable snacks and beverages, such as beer and pretzels 
                (and wasabi!), as part of your comprehensive employee
                incentive program (as if the rewards of working for Ninja
                Burger: the RPG were not enough!)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     Once the employees are assembled, the Ninja Manager selected
                and the supplies provided, everyone should gather around the
                conference/kitchen table, create their Ninja and start making
                deliveries (in 30 minutes or less, or you WILL commit Seppuku.)

     HOW TO BEER AND PRETZELS ROLEPLAY!
    </h2>
    <p>
     Most role-playing games promise that you'll be swept into a world of fantasy
                and adventure, where you will take up the roles of mighty heroes and
                wizards, wielding power and weapons, beyond the ken of mortal men.
                Some other games promise that their sublime storytelling will be a source of uplifting 
                joy for the player, allowing you to embark upon a journey of personal growth
                and emotional heartbreak. Ninja Burger: the RPG uses the BEER ENGINE: Beer and
                Pretzels Role-Playing Game System, which only promises to waste a few hours of
                your life, and let you get right down to the fun. We also promise that the game will
                be simple enough to play inebriated, and getting your character sheet covered in
                grease and pretzel salt will only heighten the experience.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     In BEER ENGINE™ games, your character has four stats - STRENGTH, AGILITY, KI,
                and EXTRANEOUS. To do things in the game, like sneaking past a security guard,
                you will try to roll under a stat on a number of six-sided dice. The harder an action
                is to perform, the more d6 (a fancy gamer term for six-sided, "regular", dice) you
                need to roll. Add the dice together, if the result is less than your stat, you succeed.
                Now that you understand the basics of Beer and Pretzels Role-Playing, PREPARE
                YOURSELF FOR AN EXCITING CAREER AT NINJA BURGER™!
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-8">
     CREATING YOUR NINJA!
    </h3>
    <p>
     Grab a Ninja Employment Reference Form (NERF) Located in the center of
                the book, a pencil, and at least 3 six-siders. Roll 3d6, 4 times, and write
                down the results next to the four stats on your NERF. The higher your stat
                the better, but it's not worth cheating to get good stats since your honor as a Ninja
                would be besmirched if you lied on your job application like that. All employment
                with Ninja Burger™ and Ninja Burger: the RPG is "at will" - at the will of the Ninja
                Manager, that is. If you have no honor, and decide to cheat, Ninja Burger™ management 
                reserves the right to fire you (without benefits or notice) and lop off your
                stinking, honorless head! If you cheat, you WILL DIE!
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-8">
     THE FOUR STATS!
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      STRENGTH (S)
     </strong>
     - Is a measure of how big, mean,
                tough and strong a Ninja is. When you want to
                break something, lift something, hurt something, or
                otherwise act macho, you roll against STRENGTH. It
                also determines how hard your character is to kill.
                Each Ninja starts with a number of HITS equal to
                their STRENGTH. HITS are a gague of your Ninja's
                life, whenever you take damage (DAM) you reduce
                the number of HITS your Ninja has. (See the HOW
                TO KILL THINGS! section for more information on
                HITS and damage.)

     <strong>
      AGILITY (A)
     </strong>
     - Is a gauge of how flexible, athletic and dexterous 
                your Ninja is. When you want to sneak, dodge, or melt
                into the shadows; you roll against AGILITY. It also determines
                how difficult it is for others to strike you by governing your
                Combat Dice (CD). CD indicates the number of dice others
                need to roll to strike your Ninja. To determine your Ninja's
                CD consult the Handy CD Chart. (See HOW TO KILL THINGS!
                for more information on COMBAT DICE.)

     <strong>
      KI (K)
     </strong>
     - Is a measure of the Ninja's intelligence, knowledge, self-control, and
                centeredness with the very nature of the earth. KI determines how well you do at
                mental feats like using Ninja Magic, or pondering the spiritual ramifications of Fries
                of Our Ancestors. (See NINJA WUJENITSU! for more information on Ninja Magic.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     <strong>
      EXTRANEOUS (E)
     </strong>
     - Is a useless stat (or is it?) used for
                things like daydreaming or repairing holes in your Ninja
                gear when it's torn apart by terrorist gunfire. When
                you're doing something that has no bearing on killing
                stuff, getting hurt or blowing things up, roll against
                EXTRANEOUS. It also determines how fast your Ninja is
                by governing their MOVE. Most Ninja Burger: the RPG
                take place on a map with neat little square drawn in.
                MOVE determines how many 5 foot squares a Ninja can
                move in one action. (See THE TAKING OF ACTIONS! for more information on
                MOVE.) To determine your Ninja's MOVE consult the Handy MOVE Chart.

     Ninja SKILLS!
    </h3>
    <p>
     All Ninja are trained from the age of five in the twenty Arts of the Ninja.
                These skills are areas of knowledge in which the Ninja Masters have deemed
                all Ninja must be proficient. In fact, Ninja train so hard in these areas that
                they are unable to perform any other action! If a player can't make a case that one
                of these skills can explain their Ninja's action, the Ninja Manager should forbid the
                player from attempting the action.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     Each skill is governed by one of the four stats. When a Ninja wants to use a skill,
                the Ninja Manager tells them how many dice to roll - the DIFFICULTY. Then the
                Ninja tries to roll UNDER their stat using that number of d6 and adds them together,
                if the result is less than the stat in question, the action is succeessfull.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     All Ninja are particularly talented in four disciplines, and are said to have mastered
                these skills. When creating your Ninja, roll 1d6 for each of the four attributes
                (STRENGTH, AGILITY, KI, and EXTRANEOUS), and circle the skill listed under that
                stat on the NERF. Congratulations, you are now a master of that skill! As there are
                only 5 skills per category, if you roll a 6, you may pick any of the skills under that
                stat to master. When a Ninja masters a skill, they receive a bonus die to all actions
                involving that skill - the DIFFICULTY of performing those actions is reduced by 1 die.
                If you are already a master of a particular skill (through your clan, for example) and
                you roll for the same skill again you are an unlucky Ninja. There is no double
                mastery and you may not choose a new one!

      Example:
     </strong>
     Ryuken wants to silently shatter a window to enter a building without
                being noticed. Being a Ninja, he knows CHOHO, a KI skill. The Ninja Manager tells
                Ryuken that the DIFFICULTY of silently shattering the window is 4 dice; so Ryuken
                rolls 4d6, trying to score under his KI of 9. He rolls a 12 and causes quite a commotion, 
                as he loudly shatters the window. Ramen wants to try the same maneuver on
                the opposite side of the building. As a master of CHOHO, Ramen gets to reduce the
                DIFFICULTY of the action by one die. The Ninja Manager said it was 4 dice of
                DIFFICULTY, so for Ramen it is reduced to 3 dice. She rolls 3d6 and gets an 8; her
                KI is 15-- she silently shatters the window.

      <strong>
       BAJITSU
      </strong>
      - All Ninja are trained in the care and handling of horses but in today's crazy world a good horse is hard to find; thus, all Ninja are trained in "horsepower" as well, and are required to take a course in driver's ed.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       INTONJITSU
      </strong>
      - While no true Ninja would hide from combat, there are times when it is necessary for them not to be seen. The use of this skill allows the Ninja to hide from sight behind even the smallest bit of cover.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       SHINOBI IRI
      </strong>
      - The art of the Ninja is the art of stealth; this skill allows the Ninja to perform acts of stealth and sneakiness.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       SHURIKEN-JUTSU
      </strong>
      - Intensive combat training in the use of a variety of Ninja throwing weapons; stars, blades, eggshell grenades, etc. A Ninja may throw up to 3 shuriken per attack (without the usual penalty for multiple actions) but must make a hit roll for each. (Yes, Mr. Rules Lawyer, they can be made at multiple targets!)
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       SUIREN
      </strong>
      - All Ninja are required to complete a basic water safety course before they are sent on their first mission. This skill gives Ninja the ability to swim and perform all manner of aquatic feats (including refilling the water cooler). Whenever a Ninja fails a SUIREN roll, he loses 1 HIT, a great deal of respect and the element of surprise due to his coughing out of inhaled water.

       CHOHO
      </strong>
      - Prior to discovering their true calling, the Ninja were extensively used to gather intelligence and infiltrate enemy houses. The use of this skill allows the Ninja to perform all the functions of a spy; this includes forgery, lock picking, safecracking, eavesdropping, and other sleights-of-hand that a Ninja or the honorable Bond-James-Bond-san might find useful.

       HENSOJITSU
      </strong>
      - Masters of disguise, all Ninja are schooled in the various techniques used in altering their physical appearance. The DIFFICULTY of the roll is determined by the Ninja Manager but should take two things into account: the person's general familiarity with the person trying to be mimicked, and the appropriateness of the situation. (You might think it's clever to disguise yourself as a copy machine repairman, but anyone who works in an office will tell you that the odds of them showing up at all, let alone on time, are next to nothing; in this case, the DIFFICULTY to have your disguise believed would be high!)
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       KAYAKU-JUTSU
      </strong>
      - Ages ago, the honorable ancestors of the Ninja discovered gunpowder and began to unravel its many uses. While Ninja are opposed to guns and explosives as a general rule, their ability to function in the modern world would be severely impaired if they weren't given a thorough instruction in their use.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       SEISHIN TEKI KYOYO
      </strong>
      - A good deal of every Ninja's day is spent in silent mediation, where they reflect upon their ancestors and the trials and tribulations of everyday life. This constant meditation has greatly increased their inner strength and wisdom. The use of this skill allows a Ninja to pull a specific item out of one of their numerous Ninja Pockets. The DIFFICULTY of this skill is equal to the number of points the Ninja wants to modify his Ninja Pockets roll by. These points can be used as the Ninja sees fit to increase or decrease either roll. (See Ninja Equipment for more information on Ninja Pockets.)
      <p class="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded border border-gray-200 mt-2">
       <strong>
        Example:
       </strong>
       A Ninja could make a 3 dice SEISHIN TEKI KYOYO roll; after he succeeds he can modify his rolls on the Ninja Pockets chart by up to 3 points.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       WUJENITSU
      </strong>
      - "The most rigorous of all the Ninja training is without a doubt Ninja Magic 101." (As reported by a survey done in an unnumbered issue of Ninja Weekly on an undisclosed date by an undisclosed number of Ninja.) This skill allows the Ninja to use any of the Ninja Magics. (See the Ninja WUJENITSU! section for more information on Ninja Magic.)

      <strong>
       BO RYAKU
      </strong>
      - From a very young age Ninja are instructed in all aspects of warfare, and in the playing of GO; this gives the Ninja knowledge of various strategies used in all levels of warfare. When a Ninja attempts to take multiple actions in a single turn, and then something happens that makes them want to stop, they have to make a BO RYAKU roll in order to see the error in their battle plan. The DIFFICULTY of the roll is equal to the number of actions that the Ninja attempted to take that turn. (See the Rolling Dice Ceremony, for more information on The Taking of Actions.)
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       CHIMON
      </strong>
      - Before beginning a mission, a Ninja will study all available maps and schematics of the target area and the surrounding continent. Using this skill allows the Ninja to find his way virtually anywhere in the world.

      <strong>
       KYOJITSU TENKAN HO
      </strong>
      - No Ninja's education would be complete without a humanities course; unfortunately the only course offered in that discipline is Philosophy. The use of this skill allows the Ninja to effectively mingle at cocktail parties and to spout quotations at dramatically appropriate times. The practical application of this skill is the ability to lie and con others convincingly.

     <li>
      <strong>
       MAKUDONARUDO
      </strong>
      - Arguably the most important training a Ninja receives is in the creation of fast food and the efficient running of a fast food establishment. This skill allows the Ninja to perform any function required in the running of a franchise.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       TENMON
      </strong>
      - Unbeknownst to many outside of their circles, Ninja are all trained in the field of Ninja Meteorology. This skill allows them to predict the weather with amazing accuracy, unlike the gaijin "weathermen" trained in Western Meteorology, which are only accurate about 2% of the time. Over time this skill has been broadened to encompass the following areas: should a Ninja ever be in the unfortunate situation where they were about to be annihilated by a meteor, they can make a 6 dice TENMON roll to escape the catastrophe! Also, the time spent in quiet contemplation of the weather has given Ninja the ability to enter a deep meditation to regain lost KI. The DIFFICULTY of the TENMON roll is equal to the amount of KI the Ninja wants to regain. A Ninja may not regain more than his starting KI in this manner; attempting to do so is a very dishonorable act and should be treated accordingly!

     Ancestral Clan!

     In ancient Japan, Ninja clans gave each other names based upon their locations, philosophies, behaviors and histories. In the same spirit, the enlightened Ninja Masters of Ninja Burger™ have examined these things about your inadequate cultures and have determined you would belong to one of the clans listed below. Roll 1d6 since your ill-trained mind cannot possibly conceive to which you belong!

     <strong>
      Clan of the Thousand Islands
     </strong>
     - Hailing from a mysterious island chain, you spent years running and swimming about your homeland. You gain 3 AGILITY from all that activity, master the skill of SUIREN; in addition to any other skills you may have mastered. As you were so busy swimming, you never had a chance to study, so you lose 3 KI.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     <strong>
      Brotherhood of the Blue Trees
     </strong>
     - You come from a contemplative clan of Ninja that prefers eating Ninja Burgers over delivering them. Roll 1d6. Add this value to your KI and subtract it from STRENGTH. Also, you are probably a chubby Ninja like Chris Farley.

       Clan of the Hidden Ranch

      - All members of the Clan of the Hidden Ranch are masters of the INTONJITSU skill in addition to any other skills you may have mastered, due to all of the sneakiness required in keeping the ranch hidden. Once per game, a member of the Clan of the Hidden Ranch can automatically make an INTONJITSU roll, regardless of its DIFFICULTY.

They also receive a bonus die to any actions involving the killing of Samurai Burger employees, whose mission in life is to steal the secret sauce.

      - You are occidental instead of oriental, and may be French, Russian, or Italian. You may even be Oil &amp; Vinegar and as such do not mix well with other Ninja. House Gaijin are barbarian giants who were either trained by half-mad Ninja retirees (damn them!), or who found out in early life that they were the long-lost descendents of a Ninja Clan. They gain 3 STRENGTH due to their size, but lose 3 AGILITY because they do not fit properly in the Ninja Burger™ Uniform.

       Lo Cal

      - You serve the secretive, despicable, tasteless, and incredibly weight loss-conscious Warlord Lo Cal. Lo Cal has infiltrated the ranks of Ninja Burger™ and the other franchisees, in an attempt to destroy the entire burger-loving world, replacing them with tofu, rice-cakes, and carbo-free energy boosting food substitute bars. You receive +1d6 to EXTRANEOUS, and are a master of the HENSOJITSU skill. Eating any Ninja Burger™ products causes you to throw up and lose 1 HIT. Also, you want to kill other Ninja (especially Blue Trees Ninja), and they will want to kill you if they find out that you are Lo Cal.

      Ninja WUJENITSU! (Ninja Magic)
     </h2>
     <p>
      Part of every Ninja's training regimen is mastering the art of Ninja WUJENITSU, sometimes mistakenly referred to as Feng Shui, or as the stupid gaijin say "magic" or "combos". Special hand motions allow a Ninja to perform these acts. Each time a Ninja uses WUJENITSU, they lose 1 point from their KI stat.
     </p>
     <p class="mt-4">
      For the Ninja to successfully call upon his mystical energies the PLAYER must master the use of the mystical Ninja Hand Kata. In other words, for the Ninja to produce the effects listed with a particular WUJENITSU, the player, must make the hand symbol listed with the WUJENITSU when she announces that her Ninja is using the WUJENITSU. Failure to do so causes the WUJENITSU to fizzle. Your Ninja loses the Ki but no effects are produced.

       Ryukenjutsu (The Ninja Water Ball Trick)

      - Effect: Ryukenjutsu produces a swirling ball of mystical water that erupts from the Ninja's KI through their outstretched hands and flies towards their enemy in a straight line (rumors that this magical power actually consists of the Ninja throwing a super-sized lemon-lime soda are false). Anything that is touched by the water ball is immediately made soaking wet, which ruins food, security systems, computers, and quiet shoes. Any person hit by a water ball must make a 4 dice STRENGTH roll or...

      A fiercely loyal honorable mystical wolf appears at your side. This wolf will follow your commands, fight at your side, and protect the bag of Ninja Burger™ with its magical life.

     Shinobi Itsu (The Ninja Chameleon Power)
    </h4>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Effect:
     </strong>
     The use of Shinobi Itsu allows a Ninja to assume the shape, texture, and color of any inanimate object, while in all other ways remaining a Ninja. If the Ninja moves or attacks, she immediately reverts back to her true Ninja form. Please note: While the illusion of Shinobi Itsu is remarkable, this power does not confer the smell of the object, and the Ninja will still have the heavenly aroma of fresh Ninja Burger. The DIFFICULTY is up to the Ninja Manager, based on what the Ninja is attempting to assume the shape of.

     There is no hand sign associated with Shinobi Itsu, rather the player should mime the item their Ninja is trying to mimic.

      The most fearsome of a Ninja's arcane arsenal is the dreaded Dim-Mak Death Touch. By merely touching a gaijin (any enemy listed under "GAIJIN" in the Enemies of Ninja Burger™ section) a Ninja can snuff out their life force instantly killing the offending barbarian. Use of the Death Touch requires that the Ninja touch their opponent (a TAI-JUTSU Roll under the target's COMBAT DICE), and expend 1 additional KI.

      <strong>
       Effect:
      </strong>
      This power allows the Ninja to create up to six illusionary Ninja. The illusionary Ninja can take any action that the Ninja can, but they are not real, do no damage, and can't move things. It requires an action to make an illusionary Ninja perform an action, and they will continue to repeat that action until instructed not to. If any living thing touches or attacks an illusionary Ninja, the illusionary Ninja poofs into smoke. Please note: It is dishonorable for a Ninja to let a customer see them, even if it's only an illusion of themselves. You lose 1 point of honor per illusion that is sighted. The DIFFICULTY is equal to the number of illusionary Ninja that are created.

       Effect:
      </strong>
      Aruki Tobi Waza creates thin, nigh-invisible, wires that allow the Ninja to fly about the room, run up walls, and perform various feats of Ninja coolness! While Ninja know that they can't really fly, this power shocks most stupid gaijin and otaku. While "flying" the DIFFICULTY of all AGILITY Skill rolls are reduced by two dice and the Ninja gains 1 additional COMBAT DIE. This effect lasts until the Ninja leaves the room. The DIFFICULTY of this power is equal to the size of the room: 2 for small rooms, 3 for medium room, 4 for big rooms, 5 for massive rooms, and 6 for outdoors.

     Ninja Equipment!
    </h2>
    <p>
     All Ninja begin the game with their Ninja Burger™ uniform and nametag, a weapon of their choice, a delivery bag full of 1d6 tasty Ninja Burger™ products and their pockets bursting with useful little trinkets. Before going on a delivery Ninja can equip themselves with any weapon listed in the Ninja Weapons! section. It comes with a Ninja Weapon Sheath that they can strap to their back, giving the Ninja easy and consistent access to that weapon!
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     Being prepared for any eventuality, a Ninja carries a great amount of equipment secreted among many pockets and hidden beneath folds in their clothing. At any time, a Ninja can spend an action to rummage through his pockets and gain a new piece of equipment. To determine what equipment is pulled, roll on the Ninja Pockets Chart. Roll 1d6 for the column and then 1d6 for the row to determine which item is pulled from that column. Should any uneducated gaijin not know the difference between columns and rows, and publicly admit his ignorance or dishonor his ancestors by rolling for the row first, their Ninja is immediately slain by the Ninja Enforcer Microsoftitsu Excel!
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     Once a Ninja finds a piece of equipment, the Ninja must hold it in one of her hands until she makes use of it or returns it to one of her Ninja Pockets. Ninja only have two hands and can only hold one piece of equipment or weapon in each. If a player should forget this and get caught with their Ninja holding more than two things, she immediately loses 1 point of honor. A Ninja would NEVER simply drop a piece of their equipment, except when delivering a tasty bag of Ninja Burger™ to a soon to be satisfied customer! Returning an item to a Ninja Pocket is not an action, however, the Ninja no longer has the ability to use that item, unless they find it again on a subsequent Ninja Pockets roll.

     THE SEAT OF LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS CEREMONY! (I.E. INITIATIVE)
    </h2>
    <p>
     Before play begins, all Ninja compete for the honor of sitting on the left hand of the Ninja Manager in the Seat of Lightning Swiftness. This honor belongs to the Ninja with the highest EXTRANEOUS. During each turn of play, the Ninja occupying the Seat of Lightning Swiftness goes first, and play continues clockwise, until it reaches the Seat of Fatty Goodness, on the right hand of the Ninja Manager. Then it is the Ninja Manager's turn to act. A Ninja can attempt any number of actions in 1 turn, by increasing the DIFFICULTY of all the actions. Only the Ninja whose turn it is can do anything; everyone else has to wait. Turns pass to the left, and the Ninja Manager always goes last.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     But how does one determine who is the swiftest Ninja, and deserving of this great honor, if revealing a Ninja's stats is dishonorable? Well, you have to jockey for that position convincing the other Ninja that you are the fastest, resorting to tests of speed (Who can run to the kitchen and bring the Ninja Manager a beverage the fastest?), or one of you is going to have to suck it up, lose 1 point of honor and reveal your EXTRANEOUS.

     THE TAKING OF ACTIONS!
    </h2>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     GO!
    </h3>
    <p>
     A Ninja can move about 3 feet per point of EXTRANEOUS. Ninja are masters of swift action, and therefore always move at a maximum rate of speed. To simplify things, if using an Official Ninja Burger: the RPG Map, (or any map with 5 foot squares on it) a Ninja can move a certain number of squares per turn, as determined by the MOVE Stat.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     DO!
    </h3>
    <p>
     A Ninja can invoke a House Rule, scan their surroundings, or talk without causing too much harm. These are all "free" actions, which a Ninja can perform without increasing the DIFFICULTY of any other actions performed during this turn. (See DO MORE! for more information on performing multiple actions in one turn.)
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     ATTACK!
    </h3>
    <p>
     A Ninja can attack. Since killing things is a big part of the Ninja life-style, combat is explained in the HOW TO KILL THINGS! section.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     SKILL!
    </h3>
    <p>
     A Ninja can use one of their skills. To use a skill, the Ninja tells the Ninja Master what skill they are using, and respectfully asks for the DIFFICULTY. For some skills, the DIFFICULTY is listed with the skill, in other cases it is up to the Ninja Master to decide the DIFFICULTY of the roll.

     In some situations, two Ninja have the honor of testing their prowess against each other. In these cases, a Versus Roll is used to determine the victor. In a Versus Roll, each participant rolls 3 dice, and subtracts the stat in question from the result; the Ninja with the lowest score is the winner. Note: If the Ninja has mastery of skill in question then they may reduce the number of dice rolled to 2.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded border border-gray-200 mt-2 text-sm">
     <strong>
      Example:
     </strong>
     Tetsuo and Sujenji sit down to a classic staring contest, both combatants take a moment to gather their energies then the test begins. The Ninja Manager decides that this is a SEISHIN TEKI KYOYO contest. To determine the winner both Ninja roll 3d6 and subtract their KI. The Ninja with the lowest result is the victor.

     DO MORE!
    </h3>
    <p>
     If a Ninja wants to take more than one action in a turn, they can, by adding a penalty die to each roll for every additional action taken. A penalty die adds an additional die of DIFFICULTY to an action.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded border border-gray-200 mt-2 text-sm">
     <strong>
      Example:
     </strong>
     Kenshiro is in a Samurai Burger Restaurant. He wants to dispatch the stupid Samurai Burger Worker at the counter, sneak into the kitchen and cook a small snack; for a grand total of 3 actions, which generates 2 penalty dice, as he is taking 2 actions beyond the first. The Worker has 2 Combat Dice with the penalty however, Kenshiro must make a 4 dice attack roll to strike the worker. The Ninja Manager informs Kenshiro that sneaking into the kitchen is normally 3 dice SHINOBI IRI roll, which increased to 5 dice because of the multiple actions. He also tells Kenshiro that cooking a snack is only a 1 die MAKUDONARUDO roll; 3 dice after the penalty is applied.

     The Rolling Dice Ceremony!
    </h3>
    <p>
     Since Ninja tend to plan themselves to death, the player must announce all of the actions their Ninja is going to perform in a turn BEFORE THEY ROLL ANY DICE. Once a Ninja begins rolling dice, the ceremony begins - the Ninja must resolve all of his actions, and then his turn is over.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded border border-gray-200 mt-2 text-sm">
     <strong>
      Example:
     </strong>
     Sanji is in the middle of a battle with a human resources team when he runs out of shuriken. On his turn Sanji decides that he will SEISHIN TEKI KYOYO (meditate) for 2 dice, search through his Ninja Pockets for more throwing stars, and attack the HR Manager with them. Sanji fails his SEISHIN TEKI KYOYO roll. He then rolls for Ninja Pockets and pulls out a Ninja Burger™ Meal. Sanji must then
                throw the bag of burgers, as if they were shuriken, at the HR Manager.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     The skill BO RYAKU is the only way to interrupt the Dice Ceremony once it has
                begun. BO RYAKU allows a Ninja to attempt to stop himself from executing really
                stupid maneuvers. Sanji could have attempted to stop himself from attacking the
                Manager with a Ninja Burger™ Meal if he so desired. The DIFFICULTY for Sanji
                would be 4 dice (1 die for using BO RYAKU +3 the total number actions he
                attempted this turn).

     HOW TO KILL THINGS!
    </h2>
    <p>
     In a perfect world, the life of a Ninja would be filled with quiet contemplation of
                their place in nature. Since the world has been so corrupted by gaijin, the life of
                the Ninja is instead filled with honor, danger, and glorious death in battle. Ninja
                gave up on using negotiations as a way of settling differences (mainly because no
                one takes you seriously when you are wearing a mask), so Ninja generally settle
                differences with poison, a Ninja-to, some shuriken, and the occasional Water Ball!
                Inevitably, your Ninja is going to get in a fight, so you might want to learn how to
                kill things!
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     An attack is resolved like any other action, by making a JUTSU Roll
                (TAI-JUTSU, SHURIKEN-JUTSU, etc.). This allows the Ninja to try and
                damage things with weapons, fists, flying double roundhouse kicks,
                etc. The DIFFICULTY of striking your opponent is their COMBAT DICE
                (CD). CD are computed using a sliding logarithmic scale, based on
                statistical probability models, designed to actually capture the real
                feeling of combat dynamics, but since we are too dumb to know what
                that means, we cut out the part that looked important and made into a chart.

      Example 1:
     </strong>
     Kenshiro and Tetsuo are two Ninja buddies. The problem is that Tetsuo
                is actually a deep-cover agent for Lo Cal, the Vegan Warlord, and Kenshiro has
                discovered this dark secret. Kenshiro has STRENGTH of 10. Tetsuo has AGILITY
                12, 3 CD. On his turn, Kenshiro wants to hit Tetsuo with his Ninja-to. He makes a 3
                dice, KENPO-JUTSU roll (Tetsuo has 3 CD) and tries to score under STRENGTH, 10.

     <strong>
      Example 2:
     </strong>
     Sujenji decides to throw shuriken at the Samurai Burger Night Manager. The Manager has 3 CD. Sujenji has a 17 AGILITY, which controls SHURIKEN-JUTSU. Sujenji needs to roll 3 dice (the DIFFICULTY from the Samurai Manager's 3 CD, and try to get under 17, his AGILITY. Since the shuriken are +fast, +fast weapons Suenji can make up to 3 shuriken attacks without penalties for taking multiple actions, but must still make three separate rolls to see if each hits.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     Now that we know how to JUTSU, we get to determine how much damage (DAM) is done. When a civilian, enemy or Ninja gets hit they subtract the DAM listed with the weapon from their HITS.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded border border-gray-200 mt-2 text-sm">
     <strong>
      Example:
     </strong>
     Tetsuo whacks an enraged Clerk that has 12 HITS with his spatula. A spatula does 2 DAM. The Ninja Master reduces the Clerk's HITS to 10 (12 HITS - 2 DAM).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     When someone reaches 0 HITS, their souls pass on toward Nirvana (the place, not the band). About the only thing that dead Ninja are good for is cordwood, which explains why Ninja are tossed on bonfires instead of being buried.

     HONOR AMONG NINJA!
    </h2>
    <p>
     Don't let the fact that they skulk around in the darkness and stab people in the back fool you... nothing is more important to a Ninja than honor, and the greatest honor, of course, is working for Ninja Burger™.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     All Ninja start with 10 honor points (not coincidentally, they also start with 10 fingers). Anytime a Ninja does something dishonorable, she loses points of honor and must make a Dishonor Check. Roll 2d6; if the total is less than or equal to her current total number of honor points (and fingers), she passes. If the result is greater than her current honor, she fails and must roll on the Ninja Unspeakable Disgrace Chart.

       Nobody was Looking
      </strong>
      - No one saw that. Just act like it never happened. You don't get the honor point back, but guess what - you are now Snake Eyes!
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Mistakenly Cast into the Chinese Hell of 10,000 Somethings
      </strong>
      - The grim reaper wasn't paying too close attention, because you have been mistakenly cast into one of the Chinese Hells. Feel free to make up any hell you like (Winds, Mimes, Ghosts, etc.) because, as we all know, the Chinese have got a lot of hells!

      <strong>
       Ninja Pride
      </strong>
      - Ninja are very proud. They celebrate this with black on black rainbows, black triangles and unseen parades; very much like the one that just marched by. You are knocked to the ground and trampled, taking 2d6 DAM.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Never Speak of This
      </strong>
      - To ensure that you never mention your disgraceful act, you cut out your own tongue. Take 2 DAM, and for the duration of the game, if you attempt to speak, you immediately lose another point of honor.

     <li>
      <strong>

     HOUSE RULES!
    </h2>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The Ninja Failure (?) Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     Ninja are trained from the time they are very little to believe that failure is impossible. This being the case whenever a Ninja performs an action they believe that they have succeeded regardless of what the dice say. In all actuality Ninja can't fail, and it is only our poor dice manipulation skills that give the illusion that the Ninja has failed. For example, a Ninja uses the HENSOJITSU skill to disguise himself as a security guard and his player fails the roll. The Ninja still believes that he has successfully masked his appearance and MUST continue to act as if he has. This is good role-playing. Failure to play the Ninja correctly, attempting to change a Ninja's actions, because you failed the roll, is bad role-playing and should result in the loss of honor. This rule is especially important for the following skills: INTONJITSU, SHINOBI IRI, CHOHO, HENSOJITSU, CHIMON, and KYOJITSU TENKAN HO.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The SECRET Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     A Ninja's Clan, stats, and skill masteries are all considered secret. If another Ninja learns secret information about your Ninja, you lose 1 point of honor. You only lose 1 point of honor per secret revealed regardless of the number of Ninja who learn it.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The DELAY OF GAME PENALTY Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     If at any time during the game the Ninja Manager determines that you are unnecessarily wasting time and thereby jeopardizing the timely deliveries of all the other Ninja, he can charge you with delay of game. Delaying the game is a dishonorable act, which demands the immediate loss of 1 point of honor. To indicate a delay of game penalty, the Ninja Manager should fold his arms across his chest and throw a small yellow flag (or napkin, or handkerchief), if he's got one.

    <h3 class="font-bold">
     The HAIKU Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     If your Ninja dies, and you would like to continue playing, you may compose a
                Haiku about your poor dead Ninja. A Haiku is a simple poem, having three lines of
                a set number of syllables, 5/7/5. The first line has five syllables, the second line has
                seven, and the third line has five. If you recite your Haiku to the group, you may
                make a new Ninja, and get back into the game.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded border border-gray-200 mt-2 text-sm">
     <strong>
      Example:
     </strong>
     My Ninja Ry-U / He Was A Master of Stealth / Copy Toner Death
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The HARI-KIRI Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     Anyone prematurely (i. e. before the Ninja Manager has so ordered) attempting to
                perform seppuku has, in fact, performed hari-kiri; a great dishonor to one's family,
                clan and ancestors. If you commit hari-kiri then your next character suffers the
                disgrace, starts out with only 7 points of honor, may only master the skill CHIMON,
                and is named "Wang". If there is already a "Wang" in the game your Ninja is
                named "Dong." Players of Asian descent who take exception to this rule may chose
                to name their Ninja "Dick."
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The HONORABLE RESPECT Rules
    </h3>
    <p>
     As previously stated, nothing is more important to a Ninja than honor, and respect
                forms the foundation of honor. All Ninja and players must show proper respect at
                all times. Failure to be respectful incurs a loss of honor. Some suggested rules of
                respect are listed below. However, Ninja Managers should feel free to create additional 
                honorifics at will.
    </p>
    <div class="ml-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
     <h4 class="font-semibold">
      Footwear Honorific
     </h4>
     <p>
      The application of this rule is determined by the master of the dojo (the guy whose
                house you're playing in). If so inclined, he or she can insist that all players remove
                their shoes. Anyone wearing tabi boots is exempt from this rule. You assume all
                risk to your olfactory senses by choosing to employ this rule.
     </p>
     <h4 class="font-semibold">
      Suffix Honorific
     </h4>
     <p>
      While playing Ninja Burger™, all Ninja and players must address each other by
                name and with the honorific "-san" appended to the end. For example, saying,
                "Hey Joe, will you get me a beer while you're up?" would be disrespectful and cause
                a loss of honor. Likewise, just saying, "Grab me a beer while you're up" would also
                be disrespectful. If you would like Joe-san to get you a beer while he's up, you
                must address him properly. The suffix "-sama" is more honorific and usually used
                for royalty or very favored things and "-kun" is used between friends. Please Note:
                The "-san" appendage is only used when speaking of other people; any Ninja daring
                to refer to himself in this way should immediately lose 1 point of honor.
     </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The MY KUNG-FU IS BETTER Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     A player may reduce the number of dice he is required to roll by one by screaming
                "Ki-op!" "Hi-yah!" "Wooo-oo!" or any other suitable Saturday Afternoon Kung-Fu
                Theatre sound effect, while standing at the table. Each time a player invokes this
                rule, their "kung-fu" must be better than the last "Ki-op". If there is any doubt as to
                whether or not it is actually better the Ninja Manager is the final judge. (Yes, we
                know Kung-Fu is Chinese and Ninja are silent. Sue us.)

     The NINJA-NINJA Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     The plural of Ninja is Ninja, and anyone who speaks the dreaded word "Ninjas"
                must immediately pay penance by singing the "Name Game" using the word "Ninja."
                (Ninja Ninja Bo Binja, Fanana Fana Fo Finja, Me Mi Mo Minja, Ninja!). Repeat
                offenses require the offending player to sing the game using random Japanese
                names suggested by other players (Let's do Toshiro!). Failure to complete this
                simple task results in the loss of 1 point of honor.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The NOW THAT'S SEPPUKKU Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     Whenever your Ninja commits seppuku, you must immediately tear your character
                sheet in half, stand up, bow your head and say, "I have dishonored Ninja Burger™,"
                then you must MIME disemboweling yourself (Editor's note: mime means to fake in
                an exaggerated and annoying manner; you SHOULD NOT have any sharp implements 
                in your hands when doing this).
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The SNAKE EYES Rule
    </h3>
    <p>
     If at any time, when rolling two dice (and only two dice) for any reason, you are
                fortunate enough to roll a result of 2 (two 1's), then you have rolled snake eyes-
                and immediately become Snake Eyes. You get the slickest Ninja costume, with a
                black metal faceplate, a harness complete with 3d6 Eggshell Grenades, and are the
                coolest Ninja on the board. Due to your newfound badassness, you (the player)
                can't talk until someone else rolls snake eyes and relieves you of the honor. (Game
                Designer's Note: Future Ninja Burger: the RPG supplements will include the Firefly
                and Storm Shadow House Rules. GO JOE!)

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">
     The DELIVERY BAG DISASTER Rule
    </h2>
    <p>
     Paper bags are notoriously flimsy. Should the Ninja engage in any activity that
                would put undue stress on the bag, (such as combat, swimming, WUJENITSU, etc)
                then there is a chance that the bag will not survive. Whenever a Ninja engages in
                one of these high-risk activities while holding bag of Ninja Burger, the Ninja
                Manager rolls 1d6. On an odd roll (1,3,5), the bag suffers a terrible disaster. The
                Ninja then rolls on the Delivery Bag Disaster Chart to determine the nature of the
                mishap.

       Ninja Manager (NM)
      </strong>
      - Rei-san you are in the bushes by the front door of the Tic-Tack-Taco building. It's a glass door and as far as you can see there are no windows on the first floor. Right inside the door you see a security guard. What do you want to do?
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Rei
      </strong>
      - I will use HENSOJITSU to disguise myself as a salesperson and walk into the lobby.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       NM
      </strong>
      - The HENSOJITSU roll is 3 dice, its average DIFFICULTY, 2 dice +1 die because you are taking an additional action; disguising and moving.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Rei

     <p>
      <strong>
       NM

      - You make a quick costume change in the bushes and walk through the front door, past the guard, and right into a reception area. Kage-san it's your turn. You're on the side of the building and there are no windows on the first floor, you do see some on the second floor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Kage
      </strong>
      - I will scale the side of the building using TAI-JUTSU, sneak through a window and hide, I think that's INTONJITSU.

     <p>
      <strong>
       NM

      - OK Honorable Ninja Manager, then I'll jimmy it open with the CHOHO skill.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       NM
      </strong>
      - The TAI-JUTSU climb roll and the CHOHO roll to jimmy the window are both average DIFFICULTY 2 dice. The INTONJITSU hide roll is going to be hard, 3 dice. However since you are taking 2 extra actions the DIFFICULTY of all rolls is increased by 2. That means you must make a 4 dice TAI-JUTSU roll, a 4 dice CHOHO roll, and a 5 dice INTONJITSU roll.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       NM
      </strong>
      - Rei's right, you lose 1 point of honor for violating the Secret House Rule in revealing your mastery. On the plus side, it reduces your TAI-JUTSU roll to 3 dice.

      <strong>
       Kage
      </strong>
      - Makes a Dishonor Check and passes. Rei-san you will suffer for that. OK, I'm ready to start rolling. Rolls 3 dice for TAI-JUTSU and scores under his STRENGTH, rolls 4 dice for CHOHO and scores under his KI, rolls 5 dice for INTONJITSU and scores much higher than his AGILITY. I failed the last roll.

      <strong>
       NM
      </strong>
      - You easily scale the side of the building, you deftly jimmy open the window and believe you have cunningly hidden yourself behind a small waste basket. The man whose office you entered is looking in your general direction with a perplexed look on his face. OK it's my turn. Rei-san, a woman, who is sitting behind a pile of papers, smiles as you enter and asks if she can help you. There are 4 chairs in the lobby and there are 2 men already waiting. Kage-san, the man stands and begins to back away from you, never taking his eyes off your general area. Rei-san, you're up.

     NINJA MANAGER SECTION!
    </h2>
    <h3 class="font-bold">
     Welcome to Ninja Management
    </h3>
    <p>
     If you're reading this section, you have been promoted to a great honor, Ninja
                Manager. In Ninja Burger: the RPG, the Ninja Manager acts as the Game Master,
                and so it is her responsibility to set up the game, create the delivery, run the
                customers and enemies and generally try to kill as many Ninja as possible. This
                section will detail how you can create a Delivery Destination, generate realistic
                customers, and manage a group of feisty Ninja employees.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The Handbook of Ninja Resource Management!
    </h3>
    <p>
     The first thing you need to learn is how to manage the chaos that we like to
                refer to as "the game." Generally, the sequence of events is simple. The
                Ninja tell you what they want to do each turn, and then, you describe what
                happens. Sounds easy, huh? Whenever a Ninja performs an action it's up to the
                Ninja Manager to describe the effect of that action.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The Ninja Burger™ Mission Statement!
    </h3>
    <p>
     When playing Ninja Burger: the RPG, we encourage you and your employees
                to make as much noise as possible, make complete asses of yourselves in
                public, and generally make a mess.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     The Ninja Burger™ Franchise Binder!
    </h3>
    <p>
     Unlike the real Ninja Burger™ Franchise Binder (whose rules must be followed
                to the letter or people start losing limbs), these rules only exist so that you
                can have fun playing games. Everything in this book should be fried, tried,
                tasted, basted, roasted, broasted, toasted, eaten, beaten, mixed up, shook up,
                thrown up, and served with an order of Fries of Our Ancestors! At the end of the
                night, you and your friends are the ones playing the game. If you want to change
                the rules - go ahead! You forked over the money for this game, and we aren't giving
                it back!
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">
     Department of Intolerable Conditions of Employment (DICE)
    </h3>
    <p>
     Whenever a Ninja wants to perform an action, which requires training of some
                sort (like picking a lock) or which has any chance of failure, the Ninja
                Manager should have that Ninja make a dice roll. That's why Buddha
                created these little oddly shaped plastic bits capable of generating random numbers.
                The Ninja Manager will tell the Ninja what skill the Ninja must roll against and how
                difficult the action is. The DIFFICULTY of the action determines how many dice the
                Ninja must roll. The harder the action, the more dice required. To determine the
                DIFFICULTY of an action, refer to the Handy DIFFICULTY chart. If anybody argues
                with you (the Ninja Manager) over your decisions, have them lose a point of honor!

     CREATING DELIVERY DESTINATIONS!
    </h2>
    <p>
     If you are planning on creating your own "Deliveries" here are a few guidelines:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 mt-2">
     <li>
      There should be at least 1 customer for each Ninja in the game.
     </li>
     <li>
      The delivery destination should be well guarded.
     </li>
     <li>
      People hate and fear Ninja.
     </li>
     <li>
      Other franchises are probably delivering to the same place.
     </li>
     <li>
      Always create some reason why the people in this building need to hire Ninja to deliver their food - it's Area 51 or it's a front for a Lo Cal anti-vegi-fry house.
     </li>
     <li>
      Make stuff up as you go... and, if it's funny, do it again.
     </li>
     <li>
      Let everyone see the map, and use little counters to move around on it.

     THE ENEMIES OF NINJA BURGER™!
    </h2>
    <p>
     The enemies of Ninja Burger™ are varied and widespread. Luckily, they are all
                honorless dogs and soulless insects that will eventually be crushed under the
                tabi-boot heels of the indestructible Ninja Burger™. When Ninja deliver food,
                they will face many obstacles, including beefy security systems, rabid human
                resource managers, rogue agents of the Warlord Lo Cal, and the occasional strike
                force of opposing fast food franchises. The following is a partial list of the strengths
                and weaknesses of the enemies of the Ninja.

      <p>
       The greatest foe of the Ninja is the competing chain of Japanese origin, Samurai
                        Burger. These dogs believe that they have an ancestral right to deliver food, and so
                        produce sub-standard western burgers and fries. Samurai Burger steals other fast
                        food ideas, reverse engineers the product, maximizes the profit potential 
                        using sub-standard ingredients and thus is able to sell it to its
                        customers at a lower price. ALL SAMURAI MUST BE KILLED!

                        folded red rice paper. They are constantly bowing and scraping, and
                        can only speak a few words of English "Welcome to Samurai Burger"
                        and "Would you like fries with that?" NINJA MASTER NOTE: When

                think that are just delivering office supplies, action figures, and frozen human body

                to gather information and establish a staging area for a full-scale invasion. Luckily,
                the first humans they ran into were a pair of Ninja delivering to Area 53. The Ninja
                (our first, last, and only line of defense) put such a hurting on the Oni that they

    <p class="mt-2">
     <strong>
      Security Guard
     </strong>
     - Generally, security guards are tattooed, nightstick-wielding, neckless 
            employees with a mandate to keep people out of their buildings. Since Ninja
            are always sneaking into buildings, and they do not ever have permission to enter,
            these guards are the mortal foes of Ninja missions.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-2">
     <strong>
      Terrorist
     </strong>
     - Occasionally, in the big city, terrorists will invade an office building and
            hold the employees hostage. Thus, Ninja often encounter terrorists, due to the fact
            that the only way to get fries during a hostage situation is to call Ninja Burger™.

    <p class="mt-2">
     <strong>
      Office Cowboy
     </strong>
     - Office cowboys are those mad dog, NRA toting, ultra-conservative

            "postal" and start shooting up the place, screaming "Buy American!"

            Ninja still regard them as insignificant insects that occasionally need to be crushed.

     EXAMPLE DELIVERY
    </h2>
    <p>
     What follows is a sample delivery. It contains maps, descriptions of the
                various areas, enemies &amp; customers and some rules specific to this adventure. 
                Feel free to use or omit as much as you like. You will probably notice
                that the descriptions of the areas are rather brief. This was done for two reasons,
                the book was getting too long and we wanted to make the game a bit easier for an
                inexperienced Ninja Manager's to run. If some annoying player wants his Ninja to
                grab a fire extinguisher and makes a big stink about fire codes and building regulations, 
                you have the option of making it up yourself or saying "Sorry since it's not
                listed in the room description it's not there." If he continues giving you a hard time,
                point this section of the book out to him and ask him to read it for himself. Then
                since he, a player, is reading from the Ninja Manager's section, you should feel no
                compunction about making him lose 1 point of honor (See page 20)!
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
     <em>
      The italicized sections should not to be read aloud to the Ninja; they contain all the
                enemy information, as well as, nasty little surprises you can spring on unsuspecting
                Ninja.

    <p class="mt-4">
     The Ninja Manager should read the following aloud to all Ninja:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 p-3 bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200 rounded">
     "Honorable Ninja Burger™ Employees, we have just received a large number of
                orders from the FodTekken Corporation. As delivery Ninja, it is your job to quickly
                supply them with the tasty and nutritious Ninja Burger™ products they have ordered
                without being seen. Please be sure to check the name on the order to insure
                proper delivery. It's been 8,400 Ninja hours since I ordered my last Seppuku; at
                10,000 hours, I get a service award... So don't blow it for me!"
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     <em>
      Before play begins the Ninja Manager should also assign each Ninja, starting with
                the Ninja on his right and continuing to the Ninja on his left a customer from the
                following list:
     </em>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center font-semibold mt-2">
     Mark G, Carol R, Erik M, Heather N, Mike O, Viki P, and Big Al Q
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
     <em>
      Note: If there are more than 6 Ninja, the remaining Ninja must all deliver to Big Al.
                (Don't worry... he'll eat it all. We don't call him Big Al for nothing!)

     <em>
      To add a degree of difficulty to the mission (or just to make things more interesting), 
                in addition to their delivery, each Ninja can also be assigned a secondary goal
                based on their clan:

     Map Rules!
    </h3>
    <p>
     There are 3 main map areas: the floor, the air-ducts (the lightly shaded
                bars on the maps), and the crawl space above the drop ceiling. Ninja may
                enter the building on the ground floor, through the front doors at reception or
                through the air-ducts at the air-conditioner exhaust (marked with the X) on
                the roof.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
     The walls around areas 1, 2 and 4 are 'fire walls', running from the floor to
                the roof and block movement in the crawl space. The air-ducts also block
                movement in the crawlspace. The fish tanks are only accessible from the
                crawl space. There is no way to get through the fish tanks without getting
                wet.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
     If it's not obvious, while a Ninja is on the floor, they will be seen by anyone
                in the room unless they are actively hiding.

     While in the air-ducts, all rolls are made at one additional die of DIFFICULTY.
                Ninja can enter the air-ducts from the roof at location X. Exiting the air ducts
                requires a hole. A Ninja can make a 4 dice CHOHO roll to quietly cut a hole
                or a 1 die attack roll to noisily exit the ducts. Jumping from the ground into
                a hole in the ducts requires a 3 dice TAI-JUTSU roll.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     On every turn spent in the crawl space, a Ninja must make a 2 dice SHINOBI
                IRI roll in addition to any other actions. If they fail the roll they fall through
                the ceiling tiles (unless flying).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
     On each turn, or partial turn, a Ninja spends in a fish tank they must make a
                2 dice SUIREN roll in addition to any other actions. If the Ninja fails the roll
                they take 2 DAM from drowning and are stuck in the fish tank -- try again
                next turn.

     Area Descriptions
    </h3>
    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-2">
     1. Reception
    </h4>
    <p>
     Two large glass doors open into the Grand Foyer of the FodTekken
                International building. When the doors open a mechanized voice greets you with
                "Welcome to FodTekken, the makers of Fod, an all unnatural food replacement
                product. FodTekken Almost Tasty!" A receptionist busies herself with a game of
                computer solitaire, while a security guard seems to be fighting a losing battle
                against sleep. There are 3 people waiting in the lobby. One is unmistakably garbed
                in the cheep polyester twill of a traveling salesman. The other pair consists of an
                aging gentleman of oriental descent and his young ward, who is none other than
                Daniel-san, star of such movies as Karate Boy, Karate Boy 2, and Karate Boy 3D
                and Karate Boy 5 The Return of Karate Boy!

     3. Hallway
    </h4>
    <p>
     This is your standard run-of-the-mill office hallway, it's wide enough to hold two finely crafted Japanese automobiles (or one gangly, gaijin auto). Both sides of the hall are dominated by enormous fish tanks.

     4. Mailroom
    </h4>
    <p>
     This is where we sort the mail, sort the mail, sort the mail. A disgruntled worker sits on a stool muttering to himself amidst piles of correspondence. Occasionally he picks up a random piece of mail, opens it, and reads the contents.

     5. Conference Room
    </h4>
    <p>
     A massive oak table dominates the room, around the table sit eight magnificently crafted faux leather chairs. Large paintings of FodTekken's founders adorn the walls. The room is easily one of the most impressive you have ever seen. In fact the only thing that seems to be out of place are the three men forcibly laughing at each others bad jokes. One is dressed in the cheap polyester twill of a traveling salesman. The second is dressed in the not quite as cheap faux English wool of a purchaser. And the last man is dressed in the very expensive Italian silk suit of a vice-president.

     A woman lounges at her desk complaining incessantly about the rigors of her job and the unreasonable demands placed upon her by her employer. Occasionally, she pauses her complaints long enough to tell her listener about a new online shopping site she has discovered or recent purchases she has made.
